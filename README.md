# Scroll: PowerShell Diagnostic & Rotating Logging Framework

A high-traceability logging toolkit designed for complex automation and system deployments. This framework captures deep metadata from the [PowerShell CallStack](https://learn.microsoft.com) and provides automated file rotation to maintain system performance and disk health.

## Key Features

- **Deep Traceability**: Automatically captures the Calling Function, File Name, and Line Number for every log entry.
- **Automated Rotation**: Rotates log files based on a configurable `MaxSize` (e.g., 5MB) to prevent oversized files.
- **Retention Management**: Maintains a clean environment by purging old log segments based on a `MaxFiles` limit.
- **Universal Log Analysis**: Includes a streaming viewer that parses log files back into structured objects with wildcard filtering.
- **Metadata Alignment**: Uses fixed-width padding for log levels and source info, making logs easily readable in standard text editors or [CMTrace](https://learn.microsoft.com).
- **Stream Integration**: Leverages [PowerShell Information Streams](https://learn.microsoft.com) for structured output.

## 🎯 Log Filtering Control

Scroll features a granular, scope-aware filtering system. It allows you to "catch" and save only the specific events you want, preventing log bloat by gating entries before they reach the disk.

### Filter Hierarchy
The engine looks for filter variables in all scopes (Local, Script, Global). If no specific script filter is found, it falls back to the global preference.

1. **Script-Specific Filter**: `${ScriptName}_LevelFilter`
   *Targeted control for high-noise scripts (e.g., `Deploy_LevelFilter = @("ERROR")`).*
2. **Global Filter**: `LevelFilter`
   *The baseline for all logging activity.*

### Filter Logic Reference
You can define the filter using strings or arrays to control the "intake" of the log file:

| Value | Behavior |
| :--- | :--- |
| `$null` | **Wide Open**: All events are caught and saved. |
| `@()` | **Silenced**: No events are recorded. |
| `"ERROR"` | **Single Level**: Only records entries matching this specific level. |
| `@("INFO", "WARN")` | **Multi-Level**: Records only the specified severities. |

## Function Reference

### `Format-Line`
The core metadata engine. It inspects the current execution context to attribute the log message to its source.

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Level** | Severity indicator (e.g., INFO, ERROR, WARN). |
| **Function** | The name of the function that initiated the log call. |
| **Source** | The specific script file and line number where the event occurred. |

### `Add-RotatingLog`
The storage and maintenance engine. Handles file I/O and lifecycle management.

- **MaxSize**: Triggers rotation once the active log file exceeds this byte count.
- **MaxFiles**: Maintains only the $N$ most recent log segments, deleting the oldest.

### `Write-Timestamped`
A utility wrapper that prepends a standard `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss` timestamp to messages. It is designed to wrap `Format-Line` output for high-detail chronological auditing.

### `Get-FormattedLog`
The analysis engine. It streams log files as structured objects. Use the `-Tail` switch for real-time monitoring and `-Filter` for universal wildcard searching across the entire log line (Time, Level, Source, or Message).

## Usage Examples

### Dynamic Level Filtering
Set a global baseline but allow a specific mission-critical script to provide more detail.

```powershell
# Global: Only save Errors and Warnings
$LevelFilter = @("ERROR", "WARN")

# Script-Wise: Allow 'Provisioning.ps1' to also save Info logs
$Provisioning_LevelFilter = @("ERROR", "WARN", "INFO")
```

### Nested Metadata Logging
This example demonstrates how to combine metadata capture with timestamping.

```powershell
$LogPath = "C:\Logs\Deployment.log"

try {
    # Combine Timestamping with Metadata Formatting
    $LogEntry = Write-Timestamped -Message (Format-Line -Level "INFO" -Message "Initializing system audit...")
    $LogEntry | Add-RotatingLog -Path $LogPath -MaxSize 5MB -MaxFiles 5
}
catch {
    $ErrorEntry = Write-Timestamped -Message (Format-Line -Level "ERROR" -Message "Audit failed: $($_.Exception.Message)")
    $ErrorEntry | Add-RotatingLog -Path $LogPath -MaxSize 5MB -MaxFiles 5
}
```

### Real-Time Universal Monitoring
Watch for specific errors in real-time as they are written to the file, skipping previous history.

```powershell
# Filter by a specific script file and severity in a live tail
Get-FormattedLog -Path "C:\Logs\Deployment.log" -Filter "*Registry.ps1*" -Level "ERROR" -Tail -Last 0
```

## Technical Requirements
- **PowerShell 5.1+** or **PowerShell Core**.
- **File System Permissions**: The execution context must have Write/Modify permissions to the target log directory.
